# üöÄ EDA On Product Store üìäüíº

## Project Overview

In this project, I performed an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python to clean, process, analyze, and visualize the data for **Vrinda Store**. The goal was to uncover insights regarding sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance, helping to drive strategic business decisions. Here's what was accomplished:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Processing:
- **Raw Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data formats to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
- **Data Transformation**: Applied transformations to prepare the dataset for further analysis, including feature engineering and data normalization.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Using **Python** and its powerful libraries, I performed a thorough analysis on the dataset:
  - **Sales Trends**: Analyzed sales over time to identify patterns and fluctuations.
  - **Customer Behavior**: Grouped customers based on their purchasing behaviors to understand different segments.
  - **Product Performance**: Evaluated product performance by identifying top-selling items and measuring their contribution to total sales.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization:
- **Visualizations**: Created visual representations of key findings using Python libraries such as:
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for detailed line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.
  - **Interactive Dashboards** using **Plotly** for real-time insights and better presentation of results.
  
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Insights Gained:
- **Peak Sales Periods**: Discovered time periods with the highest sales, enabling better inventory planning.
- **Top-Selling Products**: Identified top-selling products and their contribution to overall revenue.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analyzed customer segments based on purchasing habits for targeted marketing.
- **Actionable Business Insights**: The analysis offers actionable insights, allowing Vrinda Store to improve inventory management, optimize marketing strategies, and boost customer engagement.

## Tools & Libraries Used:
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating static visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.
- **Plotly**: For interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running the EDA and documenting the process.

## Key Python Techniques & Functions:
- **Data Cleaning**: Used Pandas for handling missing values, removing duplicates, and data transformation.
- **Data Analysis**: Applied groupby, aggregation, and statistical functions to explore relationships between features.
- **Data Visualization**: Created insightful visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, making key insights easy to interpret.

## Conclusion
This EDA provided valuable insights into Vrinda Store's sales, customer behavior, and product performance. These insights help in making data-driven decisions, such as better inventory management and targeted marketing, to optimize overall business performance.

## Dataset Source
The dataset for this project is sourced from **Vrinda Store's** internal data.
